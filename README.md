# What is ReHash?
ReHash is an application targeted at patients who need to go through some form of rehabilitation. The premise being that when a rehabilitation plan is written for a patient by a clinician, the plan can be placed into an online database. After an account is registered on the application, patients personalized rehabilitation plans will be automatically downloaded onto their phonnes.

# Key Data Structure
We used statecharts crated by Yakindu to create the rehabilitation plans and a keyword checker to pull any data relevant to the patients plan from the statechart.

# Reason For Development
We developed this application for our client in our last year of university. It is essentially a test of feasibility into whether statecharts are a feasible data structure to use for this kind of project.

# API Functionalities
We incorporated AlamKanak Android WeekView as a functioning calendar for use in the rehabilitation plans.
We incorporated Yahoo Weather and integrated it with our plans via a notification system in relation with the exercise module section of the rehab plans.
We used Firebase as our DBMS to store statecharts as APK files for automated download and to store patient information for personalized login.
